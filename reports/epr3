Completing all of 5 subtasks of the issues, specifically Quan was assigned the first two testings, Duc was assigned the third one, and Tap worked on the last two tasks.
Challenging :

We have faced some troubles when working with the asynchronous code in Cypress. An example is how to access and handling variable out of then scope effectively. In the end, some of team member has managed to find out the solution and complete the tests on time.
Next step :

Reviewing our code quality to make sure that code is consistent and well-formatted.
Making a draft pull request to the upstream repository.
Waiting for feedback from reviewer and make necessary changes if needed.
